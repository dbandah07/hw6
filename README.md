# HW6: Hash Tables and Boggle Solver

## Overview
This program is part of the course **Data Structures & Object-Oriented Design** and focuses on implementing and applying **hash tables**, including **double hashing**, to efficiently solve search-based problems.  
The assignment combines a custom hash table implementation with a **Boggle-style word search program** that finds valid words on a grid using a dictionary.

The homework emphasizes **hashing techniques, collision resolution strategies, performance considerations, and recursive search**, demonstrating how data structures enable efficient large-scale lookups.

## Features
- Custom hash table implementation
- Double hashing for collision resolution
- Dynamic resizing and probe tracking
- Dictionary-based word lookup
- Recursive Boggle-style grid traversal
- Efficient pruning of invalid word paths
- Unit tests and driver programs for validation
- Build automation using a Makefile
